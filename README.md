# Student-Mental-Health-Prediction

This project analyzes a student mental health dataset to explore how academic, lifestyle, and personal factors relate to depression risk. The goal was to build a machine learning model to classify whether a student is at risk of depression based on survey responses.

## Objectives
	•	Clean and preprocess survey data
	•	Explore relationships between academic, emotional, and lifestyle factors
	•	Visualize key patterns and distributions
	•	Train and evaluate a classification model to predict depression
	•	Identify the most important indicators of mental health risk
## Tools & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	Pandas, NumPy
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	scikit-learn
	•	Jupyter Notebook
## ML Results
Decision Tree classifier achieved approximately 81% accuracy in predicting depression risk. Among the most influential predictors were suicidal ideation and academic pressure, both of which showed strong associations with depression risk.
